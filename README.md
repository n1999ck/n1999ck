### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Nick, a student at Columbus State University working on a dual degree in web development and art history.
My priority in life is to learn as much as I can. I'm looking for a way to combine my fields.

Some of my code is hosted here; eventually I'll be making a site where my art history stuff can live. Some topics I've covered recently include Alma Thomas

Current courses: Data Structures, Internet Programming, Computer Organization, Discrete Mathematics, American Art

Things I want to learn: C, server systems, general hardware stuff
