### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Nick, a student at Columbus State University working on a dual degree in web development and art history.
Learning is my priority in life.
I'm hoping to work in the museum field, using both of my fields together.

Some of my code is hosted here; eventually I'll be making a site where my art history stuff can live.

Current courses: Server-Side Web Development, Object-Oriented Programming, Defensive Programming, Modern Sculpture

Things I want to learn: C, server systems, general hardware stuff
